# 🌲Evergreen Roadmap 🛣️

We'll try as much as possible to plan ahead, and label each update with a date.

### July 30, 2017, Setting up project

I, Jeroen Ransijn, started this project and tried to set up all the plumbing
before actually writing the component. That includes:

* Lernajs
* Linting
* Scaffolding
* Storybook
* Documentation
* Guides and templates

The goal is to remove all friction in creating components.
In the immediate term I hope to work on the following items:

* [x] Finish first pass of Sketch design and mention here
* [x] Finalize my color system generator
* [ ] Create a issue, and implement `evergreen-color`
* [ ] Create a issue, and implement `evergreen-typography`

Having a solid design reference and colors + typography defined should make it
fairly straightforward to start copying over and creating components.

Segment has internal UI libraries (React UI Library and Element)
that will contains a lot of the foundation for 🌲Evergreen.
