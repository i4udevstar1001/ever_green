# üå≤Evergreen

> React UI Kit by [Segment](https://segment.com/)

* Presentational React components
* Powerful component API with [ui-box](https://github.com/segmentio/ui-box)
* Dedicated UI Development Environment with [React storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* Easy adoption because of CSS-in-JS
* [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) mono-repo

## Install and use components üîì

üå≤Evergreen is a mono-repo, which means it is build out of multiple packages.
Most packages represent React components, to start using them in your React projects
you have to install them one by one.

For example getting the button:

```
$ yarn install evergreen-button
```

A working version assuming you are using something like [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
might look like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Button from 'evergreen-button'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Button>I am using üå≤Evergreen!</Button>,
  document.getElementById('root'))
```

## A list of all packages üì¶

Most packages export a React component as the default export.
Some packages export multiple components.
Some packages export just a Javascript object.

Please see the [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) to better understand priorities.

## Running the project üèÉüèªüèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Step 1. Configuring your editor ‚öô

If you are using Atom make sure to use the `prettier-atom` package,
and enable the `ESLint integration` option.

Also make sure to install the `linter-eslint` package in Atom.

All the configuration for prettier and eslint is in the project.
You shouldn't have to configure things separately,
please file a issue if there is a problem.

### Step 2. Get storybook up and running üìñ

To actually start seeing the components you have to run React Storybook.
To do that you have to bootstrap the Lerna project first, simply follow:

```
$ yarn bootstrap
```

```
$ yarn dev
```

### Step 3. Learn more in the Contributing guide

Please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) to better understand what to work on.

## Scripts explained ü§ì

Inside the `package.json` there are a bunch of scripts that this repo uses
to run the project in development, and to build the project.

Below you can read a description of each script.

### `yarn bootstrap`

Cleans, installs and links dependencies. Uses `lerna bootstrap`.
This is what you need to do to before running `yarn dev`

### `yarn dev`

Starts watching the project source file and starts storybook.
It runs the following two commands `yarn build:watch & yarn storybook`.

### `yarn build:watch`

`lerna exec` is used to run babel (babel-cli) on all the packages.
This makes the packages available within packages.
Each package will get a `lib` directory, which contains the build.
Remember to use `yarn run bootstrap`, if you are not running `yarn run dev`.

### `yarn storybook`

This will run react storybook, a React development environment that finds
all files in your packages directory that match `*.stories.js`.

### `yarn create-package`

This command scaffolds a package with no specific boilerplate.
It should be useful for creating utilities.

For the following command:

```
npm run create-package evergreen-utils
```

The following file tree will be generated:

```
/packages/evergreen-utils
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```


### `yarn create-package:components`

This command scaffolds a package with React component(s) boilerplate.
You can pass one or more components to this command.

For the following command:

```
npm run create-package:components evergreen-typography Text Heading
```

The following file tree will be generated:

```
/packages/evergreen-typography
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /src/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ-  /components/
|   ‚îÇ   |‚îÄ‚îÄ Text.js
|   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Heading.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /stories/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.stories.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

### `yarn lint`

Uses ESLint to lint the project by the configuration found in `.eslintrc.js`.

### `yarn clean`

Remove all untracked files and removes all node_modules (using `rm -rf`).

## Babel configuration

This repo uses a central babel configuration in `.babelrc` with:

- `babel-preset-es2015`
- `babel-preset-react`
- `babel-preset-stage-0`

## Creating new scripts/tools

If you want to add a script to the `tools` directory, make sure to use `babel-node`
which comes with `babel-cli` ‚Äî a dev dependency.
